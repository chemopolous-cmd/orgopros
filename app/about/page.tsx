                  We are a group of PhD organic chemists, and Harvard graduates, who believe students deserve more from one-on-one tutoring. Across different classrooms and departments we ran into the same issue: subject mastery and great teaching are different skills. <span className="font-medium text-brand-navy">OrgoPros</span> exists to bring you both.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While many tutoring platforms screen with AI or a quick test, we hire the way schools should:
                  a personal application and live sample lessons. We look for clarity, pacing, and the ability to build
                  intuition â€” not just correct answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also built incentives that value teaching. Competitors often pay tutors a small fraction of what students are charged;
                  our starting pay is <span className="font-semibold">more than twice as much</span> as typical platforms, with room to grow.
                  Your money goes to a great teacher, not to overhead.
